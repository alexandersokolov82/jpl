## About The Project

This web application provides a clear, hierarchical way to organize film projects. In the world of filmmaking, "continuity" is key, and that starts with good organization. This tool allows users to drill down from a high-level project overview into specific sequences, then into scenes, and finally down to individual shots.

The main features include:
* **Hierarchical Structure:** A logical breakdown of Project â†’ Sequence â†’ Scene â†’ Shot.
* **Focused View:** Each screen displays details of a parent item (like a scene) and a list of its children (its shots).
* **Dynamic Navigation:** Easily navigate through the project using breadcrumbs and next/previous buttons.
* **Add on the Fly:** Quickly add new sequences, scenes, or shots right where you are in the hierarchy.

## Built With
