# JPL - Pre-visualization & Budgeting Tool ðŸŽ¬

An advanced tool for film pre-visualization and budget management, built with React. This application helps filmmakers and production managers to structure their projects, visualize assets and shots, and create detailed budgets.

## About The Project

This web application provides a comprehensive solution for managing the pre-production phase of a film project. It combines hierarchical project organization with powerful budgeting features.

### Core Features:

*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Organize your project in a logical hierarchy:
    *   Project
        *   Sequence
            *   Scene
                *   Shot

*   **Pre-visualization Views:**
    *   **Previs Shots:** A gallery of all shots for a quick visual overview.
    *   **Previs Assets:** Browse assets categorized by type (Characters, Environments, Props, etc.).

*   **Detailed Budgeting (`Previs Budget`):**
    *   **Assets & Shots Budget:** Create detailed budget tables for assets and shots with fields for artist days, revisions, team size, and complexity.
    *   **Team & Rate Management:** Define team roles, headcount, rates (per day/week), and productivity multipliers.
    *   **Production Costs:** Add and manage production-related costs.
    *   **Scenario Summary:** Get a comprehensive summary of your budget, including:
        *   Total artist days.
        *   Project duration based on team capacity.
        *   Cost breakdown for assets, shots, and production.
        *   A cost distribution pie chart for a clear visual summary.

*   **Interactive & Dynamic:**
    *   Drill-down navigation to move through the project hierarchy.
    *   Editable tables for on-the-fly budget adjustments.
    *   Data persistence using the browser's `localStorage`.
